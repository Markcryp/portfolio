            <h3>Hello there, am Mark Njau and this is my web portfolio.</h3>
            <p>
                Am a student at Moringa School and am studing the software engineering course.I recently completed my high school education and opted to join
                Moringa since of its credibility to nuture and produce the best software engineers out here.At the end of the 6-month period i hope to have 
                gathered the required skills inorder to be marketable and also have a chance of pursueing my career with the best companies nation wide and 
                internationally.
                <br>My past few weeks at Moringa have been a blast and it has been fun coding with my colleagues and also our technical mentors have
                    been so helpfull and also encouraging helping us at the school and also at home.
                    <br>Hotpe the fun continues and also hope to acquire more skills.
            </p>

                I really enjoy listening to music since it really calms me down after a long day.Music just sooths the soul and helps you relax.
